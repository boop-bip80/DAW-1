# Hardware parity

> **Last reviewed:** 2026-11-01 · **Last updated:** 2026-11-01 · **Change:** minor (synthetic desktop MIDI Record/Stop, manual recording offset and safe callback/WAV draining; no physical validation) · **Target:** Avid Pro Tools Ultimate 2026.4.1

A DAW is judged by how it drives audio interfaces, MIDI gear, control surfaces and sync. This is
SoundCraft's weakest dimension. Ours is measured from `crates/playback` (cpal) and the new MIDI input-capture adapter and the absence of
wired MIDI routing or control-surface code; Pro Tools' from its documentation and Setup menus.

**Hardware: ~12 % ready** (estimated). **Performance: ~35 %** (estimated; nothing benchmarked
against Pro Tools). Remaining ≈ 110–180 h for hardware, 40–70 h for performance.

## Audio interfaces

| Buffer size (32–2048) | ✅ | 🟡 device buffer when the driver allows it (not yet verified); mix in 512-sample blocks | 🟡 device buffer 16–8192 (verified 128 on ASIO, 256 on WASAPI); mix in 512-sample blocks | 🟡 (not yet verified) | 🟡 | ❌ |
| Duplex stream on one clock | ✅ | ❌ separate input/output streams | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

| Latency reporting and record offset compensation | ✅ | 🟡 manual ±500 ms offset only; no measurement | 🟡 manual offset only | 🟡 manual offset only | ❌ | ❌ |
| Sample rate follows the session; resample when it can't | ✅ (switches device) | 🟡 resamples (input pitch bug fixed, #28) | 🟡 | 🟡 | 🟡 | 🟡 |
| Avid HDX / HD Native DSP, Hybrid Engine DSP mode | ✅ | ❌ (out of reach: Avid hardware) | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Disk allocation / record to disk | ✅ | 🟡 WAV takes stream to disk through a background writer; hardware unverified | 🟡 same writer | 🟡 same writer | ❌ | ❌ |

## MIDI

A bounded MIDI 1.0 decoder, timestamped take assembler and native `midir` input queue exist (`soundcraft-midi::live` and `device`, Linux/macOS/Windows). Setup › Playback Engine can rescan and save native MIDI input selections. The desktop Record/Stop lifecycle opens selected native inputs, drains callbacks and commits tempo-mapped, undoable MIDI takes to armed MIDI/instrument tracks; synthetic tests cover MIDI-only recording, timestamp normalization and Stop draining. It does **not** provide live instrument audition or external MIDI output, and track-specific port/channel input assignment is incomplete. No physical keyboard was tested; Web has no native adapter. Hardware readiness percentages remain unchanged.

| Feature | Pro Tools | SoundCraft (all platforms) |
|---|---|---|
| MIDI input devices (keyboards, pads) | ✅ | 🟡 desktop native input Record/Stop to armed tracks tested synthetically; no hardware test, live audition or per-track port/channel assignment yet |
| MIDI output to external gear | ✅ | ❌ |
| MIDI Thru, input filter | ✅ | ❌ (stored flags only) |
| MIDI Beat Clock out, MTC generate/chase | ✅ | ❌ |
| MIDI learn / controller mapping | ✅ (via surfaces and plug-in maps) | ❌ |
| Virtual MIDI keyboard | ✅ (MIDI Keyboard window) | 🟡 window exists, no live audition path |

## Control surfaces

| Feature | Pro Tools | SoundCraft |
|---|---|---|
| EUCON (S1/S3/S4/S6, Dock, Control app) | ✅ | ❌ Avid-proprietary SDK; owner decision |
| HUI | ✅ | ❌ |
| Mackie Control Universal | ✅ (via HUI emulation and personalities) | ❌ |
| Generic MIDI controller personalities | ✅ | ❌ |

## Sync and video hardware

| Feature | Pro Tools | SoundCraft |
|---|---|---|
| LTC / MTC chase, 9-pin machine control | ✅ (Ultimate) | ❌ |
| Word clock / video reference awareness | ✅ via interface | ❌ |
| Video output to a second display or video card | ✅ | ❌ (video window only) |
| Satellite linking of systems | ✅ | ❌ |

## Performance

| Feature | Pro Tools | SoundCraft | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Parallel mixing across cores | ✅ | ✅ | `soundcraft-mix` renders independent strips in parallel (rayon) |
| Plugin delay compensation | ✅ | ✅ | Bounces of a bus that an aux returns onto are compensated like the main mix (#246). |
| Disk streaming of long sources | ✅ | ❌ | Whole files decoded into the `SourcePool` |
| Track count (Ultimate: 2,048 voices) | ✅ | unmeasured | No benchmark exists; add `cargo xtask bench` |
| Real-time audio thread discipline | ✅ | ✅ | No blocking/allocation in steady state, audio-thread-aware logger |
| Freeze / commit to save CPU | ✅ | 🟡 | `track.commit` renders; `track.freeze` only sets a flag (no CPU saved) |
| GPU-accelerated UI | — | ✅ (wgpu/glow via eframe) | llvmpipe X11 issue #107 |

## Revision history

| Date | Change | Summary |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-11-01 | minor | Desktop Record/Stop now drives native MIDI input and undoable armed-track takes in synthetic tests; manual ±500 ms recording offset and callback-drain safeguards, no measured duplex latency or physical keyboard evidence |
| 2026-11-01 | minor | Bounded recording routes avoid wrong-channel capture; native MIDI selector and synthetic recording bridge added, still not wired to app transport; no physical or duplex validation |
| 2026-10-31 | minor | Native MIDI port discovery and capture API added but not wired to playback or armed tracks; corrected WAV take-to-disk evidence; hardware and duplex tests remain open |
| 2026-10-13 | trivial | bounces of a bus fed by an aux compensate its latency (#246) |
| 2026-10-12 | minor | Audio device settings: system, output, input, sample rate and buffer size; opt-in ASIO |
| 2026-10-10 | major | Created: audit of audio interface, MIDI, control-surface, sync and performance support against Pro Tools 2026.4.1 |
